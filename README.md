# My Javascript Content!

I'm learning JavaScript as a hobby and for a project(s)!
I will be using a book called: "Javascript: All-In-One" created by Chris Minnick to guide me through learning JavaScript! I highly recommend reading this book instead of watching YouTube tutorials! This book helped me learn more consistently!

```javascript
let expressionVar = ':D'
alert(expressionVar)
```
